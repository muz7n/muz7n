**The Demon King | Master of Code**

Welcome to my realm. I am Muzan Kibutsuji, the undying entity who has mastered not just the arts of demonkind, but also the realms of programming. Code flows through my veins like the blood of my countless creations. I am an architect of the night, a weaver of dark algorithms. If you seek to challenge me, proceed with caution... my skills know no limits.

## 🔥 What I Do 🔥
I code as I dominate: swiftly, efficiently, and with pure elegance.  
Here are some of the languages and tools I wield:

- **Languages**: Python 🐍, JavaScript ⚡, Java ☕, C/C++ 💻, Go 🌐, Ruby 💎, Rust 🔥, Swift 🍏, and more…
- **Frameworks**: React ⚛️, Django 🐍, Flask 🕸️, Vue.js 👁️, Angular 🌀, and many others.
- **DevOps Tools**: Docker 🐳, Kubernetes ⛩️, Terraform 🛠️, CI/CD pipelines ⚙️
- **Databases**: SQL 🗃️, NoSQL ⚡ (MongoDB, Firebase), and Graph Databases 🌑

If you can dream it, I can code it — and if you don’t dream it, I’ll make sure you do.

## 🌑 The Demon Behind The Code  
I have walked the earth for centuries, and in that time, I have mastered more than just dark arts. I have studied countless disciplines, learning not just to create, but to manipulate. In my world, **code is power**.

Some say I am a leader. Some say I am a tyrant. But one thing is certain: I am **unconquerable**.

> "A powerful demon does not wait for the world to bow. It **bends the world** to its will." — Muzan Kibutsuji

## 🔥 My Projects 🔥  
These are my latest experiments in the art of creation. Do not be fooled by their seemingly mundane nature; each one holds untold power:

- **[Blood Tracker](#)** — Track your own bloodline or track the blood of your enemies.
- **[Demon Simulator](#)** — A project to create simulations of powerful demon encounters.
- **[Eternal Night](#)** — An open-source application that controls the night. Not literally, but close enough.
